# The dotfiles

These are my dotfiles.  The zsh theme is custom from me, and uses emoji characters--it was edited from an original provided by the install.  The colors folder has slight modifications to the nightfly theme used in the vimrc.  UltiSnips holds my current vim snippets.  You should just have to run the install script.

```
$ sh setup.sh
